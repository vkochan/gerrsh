gerrsh is a yet another tool for review changes from Gerrit inspired by git-review.

Usage:
    List all open reviews:
        $ gerrsh

    List all open reviews which has comments on patch set:
        $ gerrsh -C

    List all open reviews which has no conflicts (mergeable):
        $ gerrsh -M

    List all open reviews in which the owner is myself:

        $ gerrsh --my

    Checkout change from Gerrit into local git repo - it will create new branch
    (if it does not exist) and checkout into it:

        $ gerrsh -c

    Show review comments in form of diff, it allows to redirect it into file
    and apply it as a patch to local git repository and easy see them with some
    git diff tool (vim-fugitive).Such approach allows to browse over comments
    in terminal mode:

        $ gerrsh --comments-diff CHANGEID

    Apply diff from previous option into local git repository (changes will be showed by git
    as 'modified'), it is recommented to perform 'git reset --hard HEAD' before applying:

        $ gerrsh --comments-apply CHANGEID

    Submit review reply:

        $ gerrsh --review-msg 'nice!' --review-score +1 CHANGEID
        $ gerrsh --review-msg 'needs to be refactored' CHANGEID
        $ gerrsh --review-score +1 CHANGEID

    Show review info:

        $ gerrsh CHANGEID
